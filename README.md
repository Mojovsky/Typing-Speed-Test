# TypeMojo

Simple typing speed test which calculates:

- WPM per test and historical average
- Accuracy per test and historical average
- Number of errors (wrongly typed letters) per test and historical average

In order to start a test, press `ENTER`. During a test you can press `ESC` to reset the test.

The test requires you to press `SPACE` between words, but they do not count towards correct or incorrect characters.

## Features to add/improve

- Cursor indicator
- Live statistics
- Option to choose test length time
- Option to increase font size
- Practice mode

## Notable bugs

- User is allowed to continue typing after timer runs out. Could be taken as a poor man's practice mode ;)
- Not able to backspace on the last letter of a word. You can press space and come back to it, but it's all about speeed baby!
- Probably a ton more which I'm going to hear about in my reviews!

## ENJOY!
